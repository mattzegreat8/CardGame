The game begins by the cards being dealt to each of the two players until the deck is completely distributed. 
After that each player plays one card. 
Whoever plays the highest card that round gets both the players cards.
If they play the same card, player 1 automatically wins.
Which means player 1 collects both cards.
The player that has all the cards in the end, wins the game.
